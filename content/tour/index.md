      title: What We Are Working On
      text: |
        Since Galileo first proposed the idea of material strength limitations, humanity has spent centuries developing theories of material damage. Yet to this day, one critical question remains unanswered: **How does mechanics lead to brain damage (injury)?** This gap in knowledge is unacceptable.  

        💡To address it, The Yuzhe Lab focuses on four key directions:  
        - Uncovering the mechanical mechanisms of brain injury  
        - Building accurate brain injury models  
        - Developing high-precision brain injury monitoring devices  
        - Designing advanced protective equipment against brain injury  

        🚀 Join us as we push the boundaries of science and technology!

      title: 我们的研究方向
      text: |
        自伽利略首次提出材料强度极限的概念以来，人类已花费数百年发展材料损伤理论。然而，至今仍有一个关键问题尚未解答：**力学是如何导致脑损伤（受伤）的？** 这一知识空白是不可接受的。

        💡 为了解决这一问题，Yuzhe Lab重点关注四个方向：
        - 揭示脑损伤的力学机制
        - 构建精确的脑损伤模型
        - 开发高精度脑损伤监测设备
        - 设计先进的脑损伤防护装备

        🚀 加入我们，一起推动科学与技术的前沿！
