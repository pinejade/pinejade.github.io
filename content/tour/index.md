      title: What We Are Working On
      text: |
        Since Galileo first proposed the idea of material strength limitations, humanity has spent centuries developing theories of material damage. Yet to this day, one critical question remains unanswered: **How does mechanics lead to brain damage (injury)?** This gap in knowledge is unacceptable.  

        To address it, The Yuzhe Lab focuses on four key directions:  
        - Uncovering the mechanical mechanisms of brain injury  
        - Building accurate brain injury models  
        - Developing high-precision brain injury monitoring devices  
        - Designing advanced protective equipment against brain injury  

        üöÄ Join us as we push the boundaries of science and technology!
